# Odunnu

## Description

**Odunnu Odunnu** is a whimsical, “useless” game built in Godot that turns traditional gaming mechanics upside down. Centered around the quirky concept of aimless exploration, **Odunnu Odunnu** features a single car that moves in surprising and unexpected directions. Here’s the catch: press **left** to make it go **right**, and press **right** to make it go **left**. Each key press creates a new, random path, making control nearly impossible in the best way.

In _Odunnu Odunnu_, there are no missions, no high scores, and no end goals—just the simple joy of watching a car move in chaotic, unpredictable ways. The game invites you to embrace randomness, defy logic, and enjoy the playful absurdity of a car wandering with no destination.

Odunnu Odunnu can be made more 'useless' by randomizing the all the controls every 10s. This part can be completed in the future and couldn't be incorporated now due to time restrictions.

## Features

- **Inverted Controls**: Pressing left makes the car go right, and pressing right makes it go left.
- **Unpredictable Motion**: Each key press sends the car in a new, random direction.
- **Simple, Lighthearted Fun**: No goals, no finish line—just a carefree experience.
- **Minimalist Design**: An uncomplicated world where the car’s random movement is the main attraction.
